/* 
    **COVERARE
    --the coverage of a code is a measure (in percentaje) that measure the grade in that code was tested
    --.for instance 80% of coverage means an 80% of the application tested
    --this percentaje is result of amount of lines that exists and lines of code tested
    --other example is 70% of coverage for a class tested but an 50% of coverage for the project
    --it is not necessary a 100% of coverage for a project
    --now the recommended coverage is between 60% - 80%, depending of type of application that we are programming
    --the most important is quality of unit test that only cover lines 
    --it is better to test only a 40% but that unit test is good done
